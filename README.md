⚽ Premier League 2024/25 KPI Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyses the 2024/25 Premier League season by transforming raw match-level data into structured team-level performance KPIs, which are then visualised in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The objective was to build a complete analytical pipeline:

Ingest raw season data

Transform match-level data into team-level records

Aggregate season statistics

Engineer performance KPIs

Deliver executive-ready dashboards

This project demonstrates SQL-based data transformation, KPI engineering, and business-focused dashboard design.

🧱 Data Pipeline Overview

The analytical workflow follows a structured transformation process:

Raw match data and team reference data were ingested into SQL.

Match data was enriched by joining team metadata.

Each match was expanded into two team-level records (home and away).

Season-level metrics were aggregated per team.

A league table was constructed and ordered by points.

Custom KPIs were engineered for analytical use in Power BI.

The final output table (03_kpi_table.csv) was used as the primary dataset for dashboard development.

🧮 SQL Transformation

The SQL pipeline performs:

Table creation and ingestion of raw data

Match-to-team row transformation

Points calculation (Win = 3, Draw = 1, Loss = 0)

Season-level aggregation

Goal difference calculation

KPI engineering for dashboard consumption
